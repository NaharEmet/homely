# Company Ops Build Plan — Hermees V0 (Postgres backbone + Human Interface)

Distinct claim board for the `company-ops/` workstream (autonomous-company
instrumentation for Hermees/BuildMy.house). This is **not** the Homely app
board — do not add these tickets to the root `PLAN.md`, and Homely tickets
never land here. Spec: `/home/nahar/.claude/plans/ticklish-conjuring-horizon.md`
(read that file for full phase descriptions; this board only carries the
phases actually being executed).

Every ticket is dispatched to an opencode worker and independently verified
by the manager (Claude) before being marked `done` — the manager never edits
`company_ops/` source directly. Concurrent opencode dispatches are capped at
3 at any time.

**Standing rule (2026-09-06, applies to every ticket on this board from here
forward): never deprecate-in-place.** When a ticket replaces or removes a
system/library/schema/config, its Definition of Done requires *full removal*
of the old thing in the same change — no commented-out code, no "kept for
reference" stubs, no dual-documented paths, no leftover state/session files,
no unused env vars left in `.env.example`.

**Credential boundary:** no live Neon Postgres project, no pgEdge account,
exists yet. Nothing in this batch invents or guesses those credentials.
Everything is built/tested against a local/dev Postgres (docker-compose) and
exact SQL for Nahar to run once he has real infra lives in `company-ops/sql/`.
Every blocked/deferred item is tracked in `company-ops/NAHAR-TODO.md`.

> Claim rule: to claim a ticket, edit ONLY your row (Claimed-by + Status),
> commit `board: claim <TICKET-ID>`. Status moves `todo → claimed →
> in_progress → review → done`. Only the manager (Claude) sets `done`, after
> independent verification.

## Claim Board

| Ticket | Title | Deps | Owner paths | Phase | Claimed-by | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|-------|------------|--------|-------|
| P1-A | Company/Observer PG schema + role grants (SQL only) | — | company-ops/sql/ | 1 | opencode | done | commit 1ddc95c; independently re-verified: idempotent re-run + Postgres-level permission boundary proven (observer_writer INSERT ok/UPDATE+DELETE denied; analytics SELECT ok/INSERT denied) |
| P1-B | Local/dev Postgres test harness + env convention + psycopg dep | — | company-ops/docker-compose.test.yml, company-ops/scripts/test-db-up.sh, company-ops/scripts/test-db-down.sh, company-ops/.env.example, company-ops/pyproject.toml | 1 | opencode | done | commit 330fb47; independently re-ran test-db-up.sh/down.sh + verified all 3 role connection strings connect + psycopg installs in throwaway venv |
| P1-C | pgEdge analytics MCP placeholder wiring | — | company-ops/hermes/config.yaml | 1 | opencode | done | commit 37a9000 + fix 32... (see P1-C2) — pgedge_analytics stanza correct; two unrelated regressions it introduced (matrix display block, opencode_manager env paths) reverted by P1-C2 |
| P1-C2 | Fix-up: revert P1-C scope leakage (matrix display block, opencode_manager env paths) | P1-C | company-ops/hermes/config.yaml | 1 | opencode | in_progress | dispatched as a follow-up after manager review caught the regression |
| P1-D | ledger.py + cli.py: sqlite3 → psycopg (storage swap only) | P1-A, P1-B | company_ops/ledger.py, company_ops/cli.py, tests/test_ops.py | 1 | opencode | in_progress | first attempt drifted badly (invented snapshots table, renamed --db to --dsn, dropped error handling, never committed) — P1-D2 fix dispatched |
| P1-E | observer.py: append-only Observer PG writer module | P1-A, P1-B | company_ops/observer.py, tests/test_observer.py | 1 | opencode | done | commit eec965d; independently re-ran full test suite against live Postgres (11/11 pass incl. permission-boundary tests) |
| P2-F | Matrix → Discord bridge swap (hard delete of Matrix) | P1-B | company-ops/discord_bridge.py, company-ops/matrix_bridge.py (delete), company-ops/hermes-matrix.service (delete), company-ops/hermes-discord.service (new), company-ops/.matrix_session.json (delete), company-ops/.matrix_store/ (delete), company-ops/.env.example, company-ops/README.md, company-ops/pyproject.toml, tests/test_discord_bridge.py | 2 | opencode | in_progress | dispatched; note DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN already present in .env from a working external Discord setup — reused, not invented |
| P2-G | Structured Human Interface (ask_information/ask_judgment/request_approval/request_action) | P1-E, P2-F | company_ops/human_interface.py, tests/test_human_interface.py, company-ops/hermes/SOUL.md | 2 | opencode | todo | ticket drafted, will dispatch once P2-F lands+verified |

## Phase 3-8 (drafted, not dispatched this run)

See bottom of file for drafted ticket text once Phase 1-2 land. Do not
dispatch until explicitly resumed in a future run.
